### Day 16 Journal – Security Testing with ZAP

- 🧰 Tool Used: OWASP ZAP (GUI)
- ✅ Task: Scanned my backend API (`http://localhost:5000`) using Quick Start > Automated Scan.
- 🔍 ZAP scanned for common vulnerabilities like:
  - Missing security headers
  - Insecure cookies
  - XSS risks
- 📈 I reviewed all alerts, exported the scan report, and saved the screenshot.
- 📄 Report and screenshot have been committed to the repo.

Outcome: Successfully ran the scan and understood how ZAP can be used for vulnerability assessment.
